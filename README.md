        This project is not intended to be a super-cool project, it's just intended to  act as a comparision between [Hug] and [FastAPI]. However, if you think something great can be done with this, please make an issue and let me know what your idea is

        It's actually really simple, but if you want to run it yourself I would recommend using a virtual environment and install all the requirements in the requirements.txt file, once you've done that, run uvicorn [FILE_NAME], open up your browser and see.
